\description{
Used to do inference about (S)(C)AT(E/T)s.

\usage{
average_tree_fits(fit,
                  type = c("mu","tau"),
                  X_cont = matrix(0, nrow = 1, ncol = 1),
                  X_cat = matrix(0, nrow = 1, ncol = 1),
                  quantiles = c(0.05, 0.95),
                  weights = NULL,
                  verbose = TRUE, print_every = floor(max(c(nrow(X_cont), nrow(X_cat)))/10))
}
\arguments{
  \item{fit}{Object returned by \code{flexBCF}.}
  \item{type}{Character which is equal to either "mu" or "tau". Determines which tree ensemble is used to make predictions before averaging.}
   \item{X_cont}{Matrix of continuous covariates for either the prognostic function mu (\code{type == "mu"}) or treatment effect function tau(\code{type == "tau"}) for the individuals in the group over which you wish to average. Note, predictors must be re-scaled to lie in the interval [-1,1]. Assumes that subjects are ordered so that all control subjects are listed before all treated subjects. Default is a 1x1 matrix, which signals that there are no continuous covariates}
     \item{X_cat}{Integer matrix of categorical covariates for either the prognostic function mu if (\code{type == "mu""}) or treatment effect function tau(\code{type == "tau""}) for the individuals in the group over which you wish to average. Note categorical levels should be 0-indexed. That is, if a categorical predictor has 10 levels, the values should run from 0 to 9. Assumes that subjects are ordered so that all control subjects are listed before all treated subjects. Default is a 1x1 matrix, which signals that there are no categorical covariates}
  \item{quantiles}{Vector of quantiles which you wish to compute. Default is \code{c(0.05, 0.95)} so that the function will return 90\% posterior credible intervals for the average effect.}
  \item{weights}{Vector of non-negative weights for each individual. Default is a \code{NULL}, which internally gets converted to a vector of all 1's.}
  \item{verbose}{Logical, inciating whether to print progress to R console. Default is \code{TRUE}.}
  \item{print_every}{As the MCMC runs, a message is printed every \code{print_every} iterations. Default is \code{floor(max(c(nrow(X_cont), nrow(X_cat)))/10)} so that only 10 messages are printed.}
